    <p>The Pillbox Hike is located in Kallia, HI hidden in a neighborhood near
        Lanikai beach. It's not offically on mapquest so finding the place will be
        challenging. You'll most likely have to navigate through the neighborhood a few 
        times or stop and ask someone as it is always super busy in the area. There 
        is also no official parking, only side street parking. I've heard hiking to
        the top to watch the sunrise is the best time but Ive never made it before
        the sunrise. Nonetheless it doesn't matter what time of the day you go the 
        breath taking view from the top will still be waiting there for you! After your
        hike walk down to Lanika Beach and take a dip in the warm ocean!

            </div>   
        </div>
        <p>Another wonderful hike with breath taking costal views of Waikiki. This
            hike you'll enjoy more greenery throughout the hike until you reach the top.
            Be prepared for stairs and going through a narrow tunnel. Ample parking
            with cheap entrance fee. There is a food truck situated in the parking
            if you are hungry on your way back down.

            history of Hawaiis Pineapple story.Tickets are $11.50 for adults and $9.50 for children

        <p>The best one of all is just being a beach bum and enhaling the smell of the fresh ocean breeze while
            dipping your toes in the warm ocean water and taking in the beautiful scenery. There are so many beaches 
            along the North Shore and each one of them has something different to offer. Some of my favorites are 
            China Man Hat, Sharks Cove, Sunset Beach and the list goes on! 
            If your an early bird, make sure to catch the surise.
